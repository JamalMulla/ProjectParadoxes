					<p class="par">Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment about quantum physics, first proposed by Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. Erwin Schrodinger was an Austrian physicist and theoretical biologist, and is considered to be one of the founding fathers of quantum theory going on to win a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. The main purpose of the Schrodinger’s cat experiment was to highlight the limits of the Copenhagen interpretation when applied to practical situations, but his experiment has also been used to disprove many other ideas. <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYyCHGWJq4">Schrödinger's cat video</a></p>

						What is it?
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						The theoretical experiment occurs as follows, a cat is placed in a steel box along with a Geiger counter, a vial of poison, a hammer, and a radioactive substance. When the radioactive substance decays, the Geiger detects it and triggers the hammer to release the poison, which subsequently kills the cat. The radioactive decay is a random process with a 50/50 chance, and there is no way to predict when it will happen. Until the box is opened, an observer doesn't know whether the cat is alive or dead. Since the chance that the atom decays is random the cat's fate tied to whether or not the atom has decayed. In Schrödinger’s words the cat can be "living and dead ... in equal parts" until it is observed. Put more simply, until the box is opened, the cat's state is completely unknown and therefore, the cat is considered to be both alive and dead at the same time.<sup>4</sup> <sup>6</sup>

						Waves and objects interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						It was obvious from the experiment that Quantum superposition could not work with large objects such as cats, because it is impossible for an organism to be simultaneously alive and dead. Thus, he concluded that the Copenhagen Interpretation must be inherently flawed. While many people incorrectly assume Schrödinger supported the premise behind the thought experiment, he really didn’t. His entire point was that it was impossible. The thought experiment also helps highlight a significant point in quantum mechanics about the nature of wave particles. The experiment helped reiterate, "What we discovered in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Really tiny things didn't obey Newton's Laws hence the rules that we used to govern the motion of a ball or person or car couldn't be used to explain how an electron or atom works. At the very heart of quantum theory—which is used to describe how subatomic particles like electrons and protons behave—is the idea of a wave function.<sup>1</sup>
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						A wave function describes all of the possible states that such particles can have, including properties like energy, momentum, and position. "A wave function for a particle says there's some probability that it can be in any allowed position.” However you can't necessarily say you know that it's in a particular position without observing it.  For example if you were to put an electron around the nucleus, it can have any of the allowed states or positions, unless we look at it and know where it is. That's one interpretation of Schrödinger’s cat paradox.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-center">
						Parallel Universes- Many worlds Interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						The many worlds theory arises from the fact that there is no explanation for how the cat goes from being in a combination of two states at once, to being just one or just the other. Moreover we don’t know do how the decision is being made. This poses a problem for every single quantum mechanics experiment as with every case we can predict how likely it is for a particle to be in one state or another, but we still have no clue how it actually ends up that way. That is where “Many worlds and parallel Universes” theory comes in.  This interpretation is based solely on the Schrodinger equation, and it tells the story of the probability wave. Schrodinger’s formula describes how probability waves evolve over time and are always in effect. Schrodinger’s equation takes the particle’s initial probability wave shape as input, and it subsequently provides the wave’s shape at any future time. Thus, if the electron goes through both slits, both equations take effect. In other words, measuring a quantum object does not force it into one state or another. Rather, the measurement causes an actual split in the universe.<sup>2</sup>
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						In fact, the various measurements could cause a split into multiple universes— one universe for each possible outcome of the measurement. The ideas asserts that, when a scientist in one universe finds that the object has been measured in wave form, scientist in the other universe measures the object as a particle see, multiple universes.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						In simpler terms the theory proposes an idea that the quantum system doesn’t actually decide i.e. at every junction where large everyday stuff interacts with the quantum system the timeline of history splits, and both possibilities happen on different alternate branches. (Parallel worlds) In this interpretation, every event is a branch point. The cat is both alive and dead—regardless of whether the box is opened—but the "alive" and "dead" cats are in different branches of the universe that are equally real but cannot interact with each other.<sup>2</sup>

						Zeno effect and its impact on Schrodinger’s cat 
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						If during the experiment you were to peek into the cat box frequently—thousands of times a second—you can either delay the fateful choice or, conversely, accelerate it? The delay is known as the quantum Zeno effect and the acceleration as the quantum anti-Zeno effect. The quantum Zeno effect was named by analogy with the arrow paradox conceived by the Greek philosopher Zeno.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						Both the Zeno and the anti-Zeno effects are real and happen to real atoms. In order to obtain information about a quantum system, the system must be strongly coupled to the environment for a brief period of time. So the goal of measurement is to obtain information, but the strong coupling to the environment means that the act of measurement also necessarily disturbs the quantum system.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						The quantum Zeno effect was first proposed as a thought experiment by the British scientist Alan Turing in 1958, although it wasn’t rigorously described until 1977 or observed in the laboratory until 1989. The original explanation for the Zeno effect was that measurement of an atom in its excited state collapses it back onto its excited state, resetting the clock of its decay process. So if an atom is measured often enough, it will never decay to a lower energy state but instead remain “frozen” in its excited state. The opposite effect, in which frequent measurement accelerates decay, wasn’t formulated until 1997. But this anti-Zeno effect is actually much more common in nature. Frequent measurements of a radioactive atomic nucleus or excited molecule, for example, speed up the emission of radiation or light.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						In the meantime, another explanation for the effect has emerged. Atomic decay rates depend on the density of possible energy states, or electromagnetic modes, at a given energy. Therefore in order for the atom to decay, it must emit a photon into one of these modes. More modes means more ways to decay, and therefore faster decay. Measurement disturbs the energy levels of the atom, and this disturbance shifts the energy levels in such a way that there are fewer electromagnetic modes at the appropriate energy, leading to the Zeno effect, or more modes at the appropriate energy, leading to the anti-Zeno effect.<sup>7</sup>

						Relational Interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Looking deeper into cat paradox more specifically microscopic particles such as electrons, photons and atoms we see that they can exist in two quantum states at once. These states are known as superpositions. Using Schrodinger's illustration and assuming that the cat plays the role of the Geiger counter that is connected to a radioactive nucleus in order to determine the decayed or undecayed state of the nucleus. Therefore a live cat would be a macroscopic signal of an undecayed nucleus and a dead cat would be the macroscopic signal of a decayed nucleus. Quantum theory seems to say that the cat should therefore be entangled into a superposition of being both dead and alive.<sup>7</sup>
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						The cat's quantum state is said to be entangled with the atom's state, implying that there is an important nonlocal relation, or instantaneous action-at-a-distance, between the two. According to non locality, if any two entangled objects are sent in opposite directions and the state of one of them is altered, the second instantly alters its state in response no matter how far apart the two may be.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						However the strange thing is that the action happens instantly, with no time for light or an electromagnetic signal or radio signal to communicate between the two. It is considered to be a single object that is behaving as a single object but it is in two different places. It doesn't matter what the distance is between them.
						That means with Schrodinger's cat, the cat is no longer predicted to be both dead and alive. It is instead dead if the nucleus decays, and alive if the nucleus does not decay, just as one would expect.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-center">
						Taking it one step further
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						If we take it one step further and kick the famous Schrodinger’s cat thought experiment up a notch by cutting that poor old hypothetical cat in half, sticking him in two boxes, and confirming that he still survives - and doesn’t - even when there’s two cats. Using Aluminium cavities for the boxes and releasing microwave protons inside them we answer the question “What if there were two cats”. This was done by connecting the cavities by a superconducting sapphire chip and an aluminium circuit, which provided a sort of 'tunnel' that the protons could travel through. The trick is that this could be turned on or off, and depending on that state, the protons would oscillate at different frequencies. "This being the quantum world, though, it is possible to have the linking bridge be both 'on' and 'off' at the same time. When the link between the two boxes was shut down, the team found that the photons in the two boxes were still connected - the cat that had been sawed in half was still behaving like it was whole. In simpler terms, the cat isn’t in one box or the other, it’s in both, because they’re inextricably linked.<sup>3</sup>
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						You may be wondering, How is this possible? Enter entanglement, a central concept in quantum physics that allows a local observation to change the state of a distant object instantaneously, or, as Einstein once called it, "Spooky action at a distance”. To bring this back to reality, that means the electric field will always be in sync in both cavities.

						Real World Applications (Quantum Computers)
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Physicists have now managed to create a special type of "Schrödinger’s" cat using new technology based on trapped ions (charged atoms) and microwave radiation. Much like the cat, the researchers made these ions exist in two states simultaneously by creating 'entanglement', an effect that challenges the very fabric of reality itself. Trapped ions are leading the race towards constructing a new type of computer able to solve certain problems with unprecedented speeds by taking its power from a theory called quantum physics. Traditionally, lasers have been used to drive such quantum processes. But millions of stable beams would have to be carefully aligned in order to be able to work with the very large number of ions required to encode a useful amount of data.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						It would be much easier to build a quantum computer that uses microwave radiation instead of lasers for all quantum operations because, just like in a standard kitchen microwave, the radiation is easily broadcast over a large area using well-developed and inherently stable technology. This ability to create and fully control a Schrӧdinger's cat ion using microwave radiation instead of lasers constitutes a significant step towards the realisation of a large scale microwave quantum computer.<sup>8</sup>
