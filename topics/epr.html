			<h1 class="display-4 text-center title">EPR Paradox</h1>
			<section class="sec">
				<p class="par">The EPR paradox was introduced in a paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen in 1935. The paper was written to challenge the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and show that it was actually incomplete. The paradox is a thought experiment that questions our view of the quantum mechanical world and is named after the three authors.</p>

					Heisenberg uncertainty principle
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle was introduced in 1927 by Werner Heisenberg. It states that it is not possible to measure both the position(x) and the momentum(p) of a subatomic particle exactly simultaneously. The more precisely you know one of these quantities, the less precisely you can know the other one.
The formal inequality is:
ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2
where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is Planck’s constant / 2π.
				</p>
				<p class="par">
				    For example, if you put an electron in a large container with a certain speed and direction, it would be possible to fairly accurately predict the path that the electron would take in the future. However, if you shrunk the box, you would have a much better idea of where the electron was, which would mean you would have a less precise idea of how it was travelling.
The uncertainty principle is also partly responsible for Quantum Tunnelling, an effect which is used in flash memory. Quantum tunnelling works because of the wave nature of particles and the uncertainty principle. Because the position of a particle is not exactly known and is a probability, there is a non-zero chance that the particle will find itself on the other side of a physical barrier without having used energy to get there.

					Copenhagen Interpretation
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
The Copenhagen Interpretation is an interpretation of Quantum Mechanics developed by Bohr and Heisenberg in 1927. Although it is the most widely taught, there are other interpretations such as the many-world interpretation which is also just as valid.
This interpretation says that in the quantum mechanical world, until something is measured, you can only have a probability of what it could be and cannot be certain of the result. Once a particle is measured, the wave function collapses and there is a definite result. The wave function essentially describes the probability of a quantum state for a particular quantum property. After it has been measured there cannot be a wave function anymore as there is only one state and so it collapses. 
Another consequence of the Copenhagen interpretation is quantum entanglement. If 2 particles are entangled, they share a single wave function which means that if you measure a particular property of one them, the other one will instantaneously have the corresponding opposite property, regardless of physical distance. 
However, if you measure one property of one of the particles and then measure the other property of the other entangled particle, e.g. position and momentum, you would be able to know both the position and momentum at the same time. This violates the uncertainty principle and so would not be possible under the Copenhagen interpretation.

				<h2 class="text-center">
					Locality
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
The principle of locality says that any for an action to have an effect on something, there must be something to mediate that interaction. It also means that the speed of light is the fastest some interaction can be as whatever the action because something has to travel in the space between the two objects to provide the effect and nothing can travel faster than light. If Bell inequalities are violated in experiments, which has been the case, at least partially, then either locality or realism cannot hold in our universe.
				</p>
				<h2 class="text-center">
					Realism
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
Realism says that there is an underlying state to a particle before it has been measured. It means that even before a particular quantity has been measured, there is a definite pre-existing value for any possible measurement already and that it exists independent of man’s mind. Realism was thought to be how the world worked since the beginning of physics but some interpretations of quantum mechanics reject realism entirely. 
				</p>
				<h2 class="text-center">
					Local Realism
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					Local realism is the combination of the principles of locality and realism. That is, the speed of cause-and-effect is limited to the speed of light and that particles have pre-existing values to every possible measurement before any measurements.
If the wavefunction is assumed to be a mathematical tool only and not a physical thing existing in spacetime, such as in the Copenhagen interpretation, then local realism is rejected. This means that there does not have to be pre-existing values before the act of measurement.
				</p>
				<h2 class="text-center">
					Quantum entanglement and “Spooky action at a distance”
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where 2 particles that are entangled exhibit a certain property when measured that is the direct opposite of the other particle even at any arbitrarily far distance. The effect has been experimentally verified countless times. 
If 2 particles are created out of some energy, for example an electron and a positron then they would be entangled. Before being measured they would be in a superposition of states but once a particular property such as spin is measured, the spin of the other particle is known to be in the opposite direction regardless of how far the particles are from each other. This would mean they would somehow instantaneously communicate much faster than the speed of light violating locality.
