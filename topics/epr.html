					<p class="par">The EPR paradox was introduced in a paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen in 1935. The paper was written to challenge the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and show that it was actually incomplete. The paradox is a thought experiment that questions our view of the quantum mechanical world and is named after the three authors.</p>

						Heisenberg uncertainty principle
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						The Heisenberg uncertainty principle was introduced in 1927 by Werner Heisenberg. It states that it is not possible to measure both the position(x) and the momentum(p) of a subatomic particle exactly simultaneously. The more precisely you know one of these quantities, the less precisely you can know the other one.
						The formal inequality is:
						ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2
						where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is Planck’s constant / 2π.

                        </p>
				</div>
					
					<p class="par">
						For example, if you put an electron in a large container with a certain speed and direction, it would be possible to fairly accurately predict the path that the electron would take in the future. However, if you shrunk the box, you would have a much better idea of where the electron was, which would mean you would have a less precise idea of how it was travelling.
						The uncertainty principle is also partly responsible for Quantum Tunnelling, an effect which is used in flash memory. Quantum tunnelling works because of the wave nature of particles and the uncertainty principle. Because the position of a particle is not exactly known and is a probability, there is a non-zero chance that the particle will find itself on the other side of a physical barrier without having used energy to get there.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h2 class="text-center">
						Copenhagen Interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						The Copenhagen Interpretation is an interpretation of Quantum Mechanics developed by Bohr and Heisenberg in 1927. Although it is the most widely taught, there are other interpretations such as the many-world interpretation which is also just as valid.
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						This interpretation says that in the quantum mechanical world, until something is measured, you can only have a probability of what it could be and cannot be certain of the result. Once a particle is measured, the wave function collapses and there is a definite result. The wave function essentially describes the probability of a quantum state for a particular quantum property. After it has been measured there cannot be a wave function anymore as there is only one state and so it collapses. 
						Another consequence of the Copenhagen interpretation is quantum entanglement. If 2 particles are entangled, they share a single wave function which means that if you measure a particular property of one them, the other one will instantaneously have the corresponding opposite property, regardless of physical distance. 
					</p>
					<p class="par">
						However, if you measure one property of one of the particles and then measure the other property of the other entangled particle, e.g. position and momentum, you would be able to know both the position and momentum at the same time. This violates the uncertainty principle and so would not be possible under the Copenhagen interpretation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Locality
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						The principle of locality says that any for an action to have an effect on something, there must be something to mediate that interaction. It also means that the speed of light is the fastest some interaction can be as whatever the action because something has to travel in the space between the two objects to provide the effect and nothing can travel faster than light. If Bell inequalities are violated in experiments, which has been the case, at least partially, then either locality or realism cannot hold in our universe.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Realism
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Realism says that there is an underlying state to a particle before it has been measured. It means that even before a particular quantity has been measured, there is a definite pre-existing value for any possible measurement already and that it exists independent of man’s mind. Realism was thought to be how the world worked since the beginning of physics but some interpretations of quantum mechanics reject realism entirely. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Local Realism
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Local realism is the combination of the principles of locality and realism. That is, the speed of cause-and-effect is limited to the speed of light and that particles have pre-existing values to every possible measurement before any measurements.
						If the wavefunction is assumed to be a mathematical tool only and not a physical thing existing in spacetime, such as in the Copenhagen interpretation, then local realism is rejected. This means that there does not have to be pre-existing values before the act of measurement.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Quantum entanglement
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where 2 particles that are entangled exhibit a certain property when measured that is the direct opposite of the other particle even at any arbitrarily far distance. The effect has been experimentally verified countless times. Particles can become entangled in various ways.
						If 2 particles are created out of some energy, for example an electron and a positron then they would be entangled. Before being measured they would be in a superposition of states but once a particular property such as spin is measured, the spin of the other particle is known to be in the opposite direction regardless of how far the particles are from each other. This would mean they would somehow instantaneously communicate much faster than the speed of light violating locality.

						EPR paper and paradox
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Einstein and his coworkers were not happy with what the consequences of wave functions, quantum entanglement and the Copenhagen interpretation could mean for the universe. The Copenhagen interpretation meant that particles somehow violated special relativity and local realism which Einstein did not accept. In the paper they wrote in 1935, they said that there must be another way that quantum entanglement could be explained. They said that particles had some inherent “hidden variables” which determined what the result of each possible measurement in the future would be.
						However, John Bell later developed the famous Bell’s inequality which could be used to show that it would not be possible for the particles to have some static hidden variables. This does not rule out hidden variables which are then updated after one particle is measured through some sort of faster than light communication. If instantaneous wave function collapse is real and there are no hidden variables, then the states of the property would correlate more than some percentage of the time. And if there were hidden variables then they would correlate less than that same percentage. Hundreds of experiments done since the inequality was proposed, have shown that Bell’s inequality is violated and that local realism is rejected by Quantum Mechanics. The experiments have shown that there cannot be local hidden variables.
						Although countless experiments have shown that there cannot be local hidden variables, the experiments themselves were not perfect and therefore the results could not be taken to be proof. The results were not conclusive but were used as part of the ever growing pile of evidence showing that local hidden variables did not exist. 
						Some of the loopholes that existed in the tests include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>detectors not being good enough to detect a significant proportion of pairs of photons. The pairs that were not detected could have changed the percentage and thus the results</li>
                        <li>pairs of particles could have somehow communicated the state change to each other before they could be detected</li>
                        <li>the result of the measurement may not actually be random as assumed but instead follow some pattern that we don’t know about</li>
						</ul><p class="par">
						For decades all the experiments suffered from loopholes. In 2015 the first experiment that addressed all the loopholes at the same time was done which still had the same result: local realism is not how the universe works. Nowadays, most physicists accept that there no hidden variables but there is still some debate and the issue is unlikely to be completely resolved any time soon.
						So if hidden variables cannot be used to explain quantum entanglement then how can the particles communicate instantly? The Copenhagen interpretation asserts that some sort of faster than light communication does go on between the two particles when one is measured. This seemed impossible to Einstein which is why he ruled it out completely. It would seem to violate the theory of special relativity. How could the information travel faster than the speed of light?
						Even though entangled particles seem to be communicating faster than the speed of light, this does not mean any information can be transmitted in this way. This is because from the uncertainty principle and the Copenhagen principle we know that you cannot know what the state is before you measure it. We also know that you cannot influence the state in any way. There is a 50/50 chance of either result. So although, you could know the result of the entangled particle on the other side of the universe, you would not be able to control it and therefore you could never transmit information. It would be a random and exactly opposite result. This means that there is no faster than light transmission of information and the theory of relativity is not violated.

						Other interpretations of Quantum Mechanics
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						Other interpretations of Quantum Mechanics have different resolutions of the EPR paradox. Although local realism is rejected in the Copenhagen interpretation, neither locality nor realism may be rejected in other interpretations.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Many-Worlds interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						One popular interpretation is the many-worlds interpretation. This one doesn’t accept wavefunction collapse like in the Copenhagen interpretation. Instead there is a universal wavefunction from which everything else follows. Quantum mechanical effects are explained away by quantum decoherence which is a loss of information from the system into its environment which can result in the removal of quantum effects from a system. Effectively it transforms a quantum mechanical system into a classical one. The many-worlds interpretation says that every possible past that did not happen in our universe on a quantum level did happen in another universe. There could be an infinite amount of other universes that are created when there is more than one option for the next state on a quantum level. The universe splits whenever a measurement is made and all the different possibilities are still realised. Because every outcome is realised, paradoxes such as the EPR paradox and others such as Schrodinger’s cat are resolved as the different possibilities all happen. The many-worlds interpretation does not reject realism and sometimes does not reject locality either. Just as with any other interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, there are many objections to this interpretation. Some of the biggest questions have been answered although not to the satisfaction of everyone. The many-worlds interpretation therefore remains fairly arbitrary but still within the realm of possibility.

				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Bohmian Mechanics
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						This interpretation also uses wave functions like the Copenhagen interpretation but also adds “pilot waves” which guide how the particle moves or how the configuration of the particle changes over time. This means that the interpretation is deterministic as how it changes can be modelled by the guiding equations. Of course, the wave function must also be deterministic in this case and this is explained by using Schrodinger’s equation. This interpretation is also non local and accepts that some form of action of a distance exists which allows for deterministic Bohmian mechanics to work. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Transactional interpretation
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						This one has a lot less acceptance than the other ones but could still be a valid way of interpreting quantum mechanics. In this interpretation, waves are emitted from the source and the receiver both forward in time and back in time. This means that there are waves between the emitter and the receiver across time which allows for the transaction of energy, momentum, etc. The waves are seen as real rather than as a mathematical tool. This interpretation is also non local which helps it resolve many of the quantum paradoxes that have been formulated. However, this interpretation has not been tested and is widely debated.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="text-center">
						Conclusion
					</h2>
					<p class="par">
						In conclusion, with the standard interpretations of quantum mechanics, the various quantum paradoxes can be resolved, by rejecting local realism. However, as you have seen, it does depend on the interpretation used and this is still a widely debated topic.
