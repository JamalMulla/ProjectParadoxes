				<p class="par">The Grandfather Paradox is a time consistency paradox where events happen that would alter the past resulting in inconsistency in the sequence of events. The name comes from the most common version of the paradox where a person travels back in time and kills their grandfather, preventing their birth<sup>6</sup>. The first appearance of the Grandfather Paradox was when it was described as a character preventing an ancestor from conceiving a child in Nathaniel Schachner’s Ancestral Voices, and Rene Barjavel’s Le Voyager Imprudent.<sup>10</sup> <sup>2</sup></p>

					Other representations
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					A common representation of the Grandfather Paradox in science fiction is the “Hitler’s Murder Paradox” where a protagonist goes back in time to kill Hitler in order to prevent World War 2 from happening<sup>14</sup>. By killing Hitler before World War 2, the protagonist removes the reason for him to go back in time to start with, creating the paradox. Also, since World War 2 was such a monumental event in human history, it is also likely that anyone born after World War 2 would have their lineages significantly altered as a result. 
				</p>
				<p class="par">
					A more scientific representation of the Grandfather Paradox was raised by Joseph Polchinski as a response to the Novikov Self-Consistency principle. American physicist, Joseph Polchinski raised a paradoxical circumstance where a billiard ball is shot into a wormhole only to emerge earlier in time to knock itself out of the trajectory of going into the wormhole<sup>13</sup>.

					Closed Timelike Curve
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					The Grandfather Paradox depends on the idea of a closed timelike curve (CTC) where a particle returns to its starting position in spacetime<sup>12</sup>. Since the time traveler in the Grandfather paradox cannot return to their starting position, it violates the idea of a closed timelike curve. Kurt Godel later discovered a solution to the equations of general relativity that permitted CTCs, which was what gave rise to the Grandfather Paradox in the scientific scene<sup>5</sup>. 
                </p></div>

				<h2 class="text-center">
					Common Explanations
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					One common explanation for the Grandfather Paradox is that the act of travelling back in time creates a parallel universe, and so killing the grandfather does not affect the conception of the time traveler since the time travelers original universe is left unaltered. Some say this is not true time travel since it involves a separate universe<sup>1</sup>. Others say that because of the possibility of contradiction, it is logically impossible for backwards time travel to happen. However, many scientists believe that it is not necessary to deem backwards time travel impossible, rather, that backwards time travel can occur as long as it is impossible to change the past, as presented by the Novikov self-consistency principle.
                                    </p></div>

					Novikov self-consistency principle
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					As a solution to the Inconsistency Paradox (another name for the Grandfather Paradox), Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov proposed his self-consistency principle which assumes that there is no way an event that happens in the future can change something that has already happened since it must satisfy a CTC<sup>4</sup>. In response to Polchinski’s paradox, Novikov said that despite there being an self-inconsistent representation to the billiard ball problem, there are also infinitely many self-consistent representations. An example would be one where the billiard ball emerges from the wormhole and knocks itself into the entrance of the wormhole, which would satisfy the self-consistency principle<sup>9</sup>. However, it has not been proven that regardless of the circumstance, there are always possible self-consistent solutions to arbitrary initial conditions. An important assumption for the principle is that only one timeline is accessible or that parallel timelines cannot be accessed. The presumption of Novikov’s self-consistency principle creates a causal loop.

				<h2 class="text-center">
					Causal Loops
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					Since all backwards time travel can only affect events so as to give rise to the time travel in the first place, at least according to Novikov’s self-consistency principle, a causal loop is created, since it appears as though the reason for time travel has appeared “from nowhere”.<sup>11</sup> In their 1992 paper, Andrei Lossev and Novikov named the appearance of items and information “Jinn” or “Jinnee”, since like the descriptions in the Quran, they leave no trace when they disappear. Lossev and Novikov called objects “Jinn of the first kind” and information “Jinn of the second kind”.<sup>7</sup> They also highlighted that an object going back in time must emerge identical to how it was when it entered the wormhole, which would seem to contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics- that objects must become more disordered over its history. However, Lossev and Novikov argue that since disorder needs only to increase in closed systems, the Jinee can regain lost order<sup>7</sup>.

					Time Loop Logic
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					The concepts of a causal loop and the grandfather paradox can be implemented in the form of computer circuits. An amplifier can be connected to its input in order to create a state locking up at either 1 or 0. A NOT gate can also have its output connected to its input to create a loop that oscillates between 1 and 0 depending on the frequency of the delay of the circuit. If instead a negative delay is somehow created, akin to that of a wormhole in Polchinski’s Paradox, the amplifier loop will continue being locked up at either 1 or 0, and the NOT gate loop will eventually reach an infinite oscillation frequency<sup>8</sup>. </p>
					<div class="text-center">
				    <img src="../img/daniel/logiccircuit.png" class="img-fluid w-50">

the wormhole.<sup>8</sup> </p>
				</div>
					<p class="par">
					The circuit with the amplifier creates a consistent causal loop, and can create an output at either 1 or 0 without any contradictions. The circuit with the NOT gate creates a paradoxical causal loop, since it is the same as the Grandfather Paradox, except expressed in computer circuitry. If instead the 1 and 0 are encoded as light beams of opposite phase, since electrons interact in complex ways, when the 0 meets a 1 in an inverter circuit, they cancel out. Both alternatives will have no chance of ever occurring and the circuit will never be able to turn on, similar to Novikov’s self-consistency principle. The circuit is in a superposition state between a 1 and a 0<sup>8</sup>. 
					Another way to look at the inverter circuit is that the negative delay will cause increasingly short negative delays in the circuit, eventually approaching an infinitely small frequency, at which point the circuit is in the 0 and 1 state simultaneously<sup>8</sup>. 
				</p></div>

				<h2 class="text-center">
					Infinite Iteration
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
					Consider the case where an algorithm accepts an input and outputs a closer approximation of a solution to a problem. Usually computers would do this an “infinite” amount of times and take the still approximate solution. With a negative delay a different implementation is possible.</p>
									<div class="text-center">
				    <img src="../img/daniel/algorithmvisualised.png" class="img-fluid w-50">
				    <p class="caption">An infinite iteration of an approximating
algorithm is created using a negative time delay
the wormhole.<sup>8</sup> </p>
				</div>
					<p> 
					In the infinite iteration loop, each iteration travels back in time to the point in time when the loop is first activated. When the loop is activated, the perfect answer is steadily generated similarly to how a 0 or a 1 is generated in an amplifier loop. If the iteration does not converge, the loop will be at an intermediate state similar to the inverter loop.

                </div>

					NP Machine
				</h2>
				<p class="par">
				
					Using a negative time delay, it is possible to solve NP complete problems quickly. NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial. An NP problem means that a problem is an “exponential problem that could be solved in polynomial time given an exponential supply of computers to examine alternatives”<sup>8</sup>. NP complete problems are problems where a fast solution for the problem can be reduced into a fast solution for any other problem. A famous NP-complete problem is the traveling salesman problem where given a certain amount of cities and the distances between each pair of them, find the shortest path that goes through each city only once<sup>8</sup>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
					A version of the infinite iterator can be created in order to solve the problem in a speedy manner. By repeatedly generating routes and checking if the route length is shorter than the previous route length, the optimal route length can be achieved quickly if each length passes through a negative time delay, essentially creating and infinite amount of for the problem to be solved<sup>8</sup>.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-center">
				    <img src="../img/daniel/algorithmvisualised2.png" class="img-fluid w-50">
				    <p class="caption">An infinite iteration of an algorithm to

salesman problem is created using a
negative time delay. A knob is used to
check that the tour length is within an
acceptable limit.<sup>8</sup> </p>
				</div>
                    <p class="par">
					By using the NP machine, even problems where evaluating a solution can be itself an exponential problem. For instance, in chess, each possible move that a player can make can be evaluated by looking at each possible response that the opponent can make, which in turn loops back to the possible responses the original player can make. This can be checked for small boards on a conventional computer but the difficulty increases as board size increases. Using negative time delays, the exponential solution evaluation can be solved instantaneously<sup>8</sup>.
