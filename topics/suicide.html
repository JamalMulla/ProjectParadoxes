        <section class="sec">
            <p>Quantum Suicide is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics that attempts to draw a line between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation. It was originally published independently by Hans Moravec<sup>1</sup> in 1987 and Bruno Marchal<sup>2</sup> in 1988, and independently developed further by Max Tegmark<sup>3</sup> in 1998. The experiment revolves around a killing device (f.e. a gun) with a trigger that is connected to a device that measures the z-spin of a particle. Depending on the spin whenever the trigger is pulled the weapon will either fire or make a click sound.</p>

            Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics
        </h2>
        <p class="par">
            In quantum mechanics an interpretation aims to present how some ideas in quantum mechanics relate to real world implications. Often, they express those ideas in the form of thought experiments as they would require substantial technological advancement to conduct in real life. There are many interpretations, some of them more common than the others. The most popular is the Copenhagen interpretation, and the one that the Quantum Suicide assumes is called Many-Worlds interpretation. We will go back to these later.  I am including results of a poll taken among 149 physicists of 8 different universities. According to the results The Copenhagen clearly the favorite interpretation. A substantial number of responders also claimed no to have any preferred interpretation. Everett’s Many-Worlds even though it is the second most popular theory (along with Information-based/Information-theoretical) only 6% of responders choose this one.

            Many-Worlds interpretation
        </h2>
        <p class="par">
            The characteristic of the Many-Worlds interpretation is that whenever there is more than one possible outcome for an action the world will split and make a copy of itself for each possible outcome. Everett called this process decohesion. The important part of this theory is that humans can perceive only one such world at a time so every time the world splits the consciousness also splits. This is vital to Quantum Suicide as the version of the person that participates in the experiment is becomes can be aware of only one universe and since they cannot be aware of a universe they are not part of this means that their consciousness will stay in the universes where the experiment failed to kill the subject. This means that the subject will experience what is called quantum immortality.

            Copenhagen vs Many-Worlds
        </h2>
        <p class="par">
An appropriate question to ask now is why this experiment requires a special theory and how is it different from the Copenhagen interpretation which is the most prevalent interpretation among modern physicists. This interpretation posed by physicist Niels Bohr claims that a quantum particle does not exist in a particular state at any given time but rather in all possible states at once. It is only when another object forces it to restrict itself to one state, such as a human observing the result of a Schrödinger’s cat experiment. The state of existing in all possible states at once is called a coherent superposition. The total of all possible states makes up the object’s wave function. Going back to the differences in the Copenhagen interpretation and the Many-Worlds interpretation if we were to assume the Copenhagen one for the Quantum Suicide then the subject would die the moment someone checked on him. Similarly, if we assumed Many-Worlds for the Schrödinger’s cat experiment for the observer even though they have no means of checking whether the cat is alive or not they would know that it is either dead or alive, not both, as would be in the case of Copenhagen interpretation.

            Back to Quantum Suicide
        </h2>
        <p class="par">
Now with all the theory behind it presented we can dive deeper into the Quantum Suicide. So suppose we have a machine gun connected to a spin measuring device that fires if the result is up and makes a click sound if the result is down. Since we do not the experiment to take forever to finish we can assume the gun fires once every second. Say the subject first checks if the gun works by pulling the trigger for 10 seconds. They should hear a random sequence of bangs (gun fired) and clicks. After confirming that the apparatus is functional they proceed to the experiment. They place themselves in front of the gun and hold the trigger for 100 seconds but it turns out only clicking sound occurs. Then they move their head for a few second away from the gun to confirm it is still functional and some bangs do occur. That would conclude the experiment for the subject. So what does this mean? Most probably the subject would convince themselves that the Many-Worlds interpretation is actually true since the probability of them dying in that experiment was:

        <h2 class="text-center">
            So why has no one attempted Quantum Suicide?
        </h2>
        <p class="par">
            Surely with all these crazy scientists, flat earthers, and other not completely rational people out there someone must have tried this one, no? Well maybe, but most probably not. And even if they did than the result of the experiment (confirming the Many-Worlds interpretation) would be only meaningful for the subject. Why is that? Basically, regardless of which interpretation we assume, for the observers the experiment was completely random and the result could be anything. Imagine throwing a coin a hundred times and getting heads every time. Assuming the coin was not rigged then this result was just one of many that could have happened and it just turned out to be an extreme one. But even with this unusual result you are not able to predict anything about the next coin throw. It still has a 50% chance of being either heads or tails. Same thing applies to the Quantum Suicide. Even if the subject would be sure that this theory is the appropriate one it does not allow anyone else to deduce anything from the experiment. But that is not the only problem with the Quantum Suicide. Another thing to notice I that a substantial amount of time will pass between measuring the spin of a particle and the would-be death of the subject. It means that the worlds would split at the moment the measurement was taken but since the moment the bullet leaves the gun death of the subject is imminent and will happen with 100% certainty. But the device is not problematic in itself, the process of dying in itself is as well. Not once it happened that a person died immediately the moment they were gravely injured, a bit of time will always pass from being injured to dying and the minimum time to kill a person is probably the time it takes for light to travel from head to feet which is obviously greater than zero and as such the Quantum Suicide experiment loses all its merits, which is the reason why no one would want to attempt it.

        <h2 class="text-center">
            So, let us assume that the Many-Worlds interpretation is true. What are its implications on real world?
        </h2>
        
        <p class="par">
            One common misconception is that everyone would be immortal. The reason why that would not be true is that death is a continuous process rather than an instant one. It is hard to make a clear distinction between a living and a dead person. Also, the way death occurs is not related in any way to real randomness. For example, a person being terminally ill with no way of recovery will die regardless of how the worlds would split. However, some researchers claim that more modern modifications of Many-Worlds (referred to as neo-Everett) would have implications on understanding quantum computing as noted by Clare Hewitt-Horseman in “An introduction to many worlds in Quantum Computing”: </p>
   <blockquote class="blockquote">
   <p class="mb-0 quote">         
“Along with locality, probably the most important consequence of a neo-Everettian view of computation is the relation between quantum and classical processors. Put simply, in neo-Everett there is no fundamental quantum/classical divide. Bits are not, in fact, a different sort of thing altogether from qubits. Classical processes are a subset of quantum processes, in specific circumstances. This is an advantage on two fronts. Firstly, the fact that we do not have a distinct idea of where the classical/quantum divide is anyway is explained by there not being a distinct divide. Secondly, we now have fundamental connections between the different resources of computing. Rather than two separate sets of resources that nevertheless may be interchanged in certain situations<sup style="color:#E5DFC5">4</sup>, we now have physically the same resource being put to different uses – a bit is a qubit with the coherence data neglected. One direct advantage of this is that we can formalize an entire protocol using the same method, rather than requiring a formal shift between bits and qubits at various points.”

Having said that it is not yet clear if the different interpretation will make an impact on quantum computing but rather will give us a different way to view the sole concept of it.

        </h2>
        <p class="par">
            Everett’s Many-Worlds interpretation is also a source and inspiration for some people as it implies that there exists an infinite number of parallel universes. An obvious implication is that everything that can happen will happen in at least one of these universes. Some hope that we will be able to grasp the technology and tame these universes for our own convenience. If we ever would get a hold of that technology, it would be the day that humanity would be basically granted immortality. Another interesting thing is that it would resolve most if not all time-travel paradoxes. For example, if I killed my own grandfather before I was born I would not allow my birth but in a completely different timeline. It can also explain why we have not yet seen any time travellers if that technology is physically possible. Simply because of the vast number of universes the probability of them arriving in our universe is probably close to zero. The concept of parallel universes is also used in many popular fictional works, such as Marvel or DC comics. This allows different artist to create stories that are independent of each other allowing them more freedom in developing the characters and setting up the storylines.
